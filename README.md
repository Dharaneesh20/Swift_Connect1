# GitHub Pages Setup for index.html

This repository hosts an `index.html` file which will be published using GitHub Pages.

## Steps to Publish

1. **Enable GitHub Pages**:
   - Go to the repository settings.
   - Scroll down to the **Pages** section.
   - Under "Source," select the branch where your `index.html` file resides (e.g., `main`).
   - Set the folder to `/ (root)`, if applicable.
   - Click **Save**.

2. **Access Your Website**:
   - After enabling GitHub Pages, your site will be published at:
     ```
     https://<your-username>.github.io/<repository-name>/
     ```
   - Replace `<your-username>` with your GitHub username and `<repository-name>` with the name of this repository.

## Notes
- Make sure the `index.html` file is in the root directory of this repository, as GitHub Pages will use it as the entry point.
- Any changes to the `index.html` file will automatically reflect on the live site after being pushed to the repository.

Enjoy your GitHub Pages site!
